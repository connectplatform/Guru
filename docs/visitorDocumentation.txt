Visitor Documentation

A visitor will usually reach the chat site by following a link from the site they are seeking help with.  They are presented with a welcome page, which invites them to optionally enter a username and enter the chat.  A visitor that does not choose a username will have their username displayed as "anonymous".  Upon clicking "Enter Chat", the visitor will be shown a chat window, a message entry box and a button to send a message.  Any messages posted in the chat room will be displayed to the user in their chat window.  Additionally, status messages will be shown when operators enter or leave the chat room.  If an operator kicks the user from the room, the user will be shown the message "The operator has ended the chat" and will not see any messages that are posted in the room after this point.
