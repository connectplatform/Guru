Administrator documentation

General

An administrator has all of the capabilities that an operator does, and should read the operator documentation as well.

This Release

Most importantly, an administrator should change their password upon first login.  There in not yet a method to recover a lost password, so if there is not more than one administrator, it is important that the administrator not lose their password.

Managing Users

  After logging in, you can click on "Users" in the "admin" section of the sidebar.  This will bring up the Users page, where user accounts may be created, edited, or deleted.  A table displays information on all users which currently exist in the system.

  Creating a User

    Click the "Add New User" button.  A dialog box will prompt you for information on that user.  The first and last name fields are optional, and will be displayed to visitors who the operator chats with.  The email field is used by the operator to log in.  The role selection box allows the administrator to select a value of "Administrator", "Operator", or "Supervisor" for the user.  Only users who are expected to add, remove or edit users, websites or specialties should be marked as Administrators.  Websites and Specialties are optional, and will only appear if they have been created on the website and specialty management pages.

  Editing a user

    Locate the user whose data you wish to edit, and click the "Edit" link in the row for that user.  This will open the same dialog box as when creating a user.

  Deleting a user

    Locate the user who you wish to delete, and click the "Delete" link in the row for that user.  A confirmation box will ask whether you are sure you wish to delete the user.  Warning: There is no "undo" button for deleting a user.  Deleting the only remaining administrator will cause you to be locked out of the system.

Managing Websites

  Websites have the same type of management page as users.  When editing a website, "name" is for display purposes.  "Url" must be identical to the url passed as referrer by developers on the referring site (see developer documentation for details.)  The ACP endpoint and API key should be provided by developers of the ACP server.  Using an ACP endpoint without an ACP API key is a security risk.

Managing Specialties

  Specialties are managed in the same way as Websites and Users.
