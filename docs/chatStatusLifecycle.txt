Chat statuses are set based on the visible members of a chat, according to the following rules:

Visitor present, no visible operators: waiting
Visitor present, visible operators present: active
Visitor not present, regardless of operators: vacant

statuses are set via an after hook in the chatSessions model.  The 'updateChatStatus' service is called to enforce these rules.
