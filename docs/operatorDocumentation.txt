Operator documentation

Passwords

Operators log in using their email address and a password.  After logging in, clicking "My profile" in the left sidebar will show a page with a password change form.  All operators have the default password "password" when they are created, and should change to a more secure password immediately after their first login.

The Dashboard

This is the main page after logging in.  Here you'll find chats in progress and information about their status and who is chatting.

  Types of Chats

    Waiting: This is a new chat waiting for an operator.  The first operator to click "Accept" for such a chat will be placed into the chat, and the chat will be marked as "Active".

    Active: An active chat has a visitor and one or more operators in it.

    Invite: Another operator has invited you to join the chat.  Clicking "Accept" will cause you to enter the chat, and will change the chat status to "Active".

    Transfer: Another operator wants to transfer this chat to you.  Clicking "Assume" will accept the chat and eject the requestor.

    Vacant: A chat with the status of "Vacant" has no visitors in it.

  Additional Chat actions

    Join: Join a chat that is already in progress.  Any number of operators may join a chat

    Watch: Enter a chat invisible to other chat members.  You will recieve any messages posted in the room but will not be able to post.

The "My Chats" page

  This page has a tab for each chat the operator is currently in.  You can safely navigate away from this page; your chats will still be open when you return.  Each tab contains three sections:

  1) The main chat window.
  2) The message entry bar.
  3) The chat sidebar.  This shows information on the customer. Some information is shown in tree views: clicking on a field expands it and shows its subfields.  The chat sidebar also shows control buttons for the chat.

  The Chat Control Buttons

    Invite: Invites another operator to the chat.  Clicking it will open a user selection box displaying all other operators who are currently online.  Select one to invite them.

    Transfer: Transfers chat to another operator.  Transfers are like invites, only when an operator accepts a transfer, the operator who requested the transfer is removed from the room.

    Leave: Leave the room.  The visitor and other operators will recieve a message that you left.

    Kick: Kicks the user from the room.  The user will recieve the message "The operator has ended the chat" and will be unable to see any messages posted in the room after this point.

Notifications

  A number inside of a colored circle is a notification badge.  These notifications indicate that something requires an operator's immediate attention.  They can appear several places:

  1) In the left sidebar, next to the link to the dashboard.  These notifications show a count of how many chats are waiting for an operator to accept them.  They are cleared when operators accept the chats.
  2) In the left sidebar, next to the "My Chats" link.  These notifications show a count of how many chat messages have been posted and have not been seen by the operator.  They are cleared when an operator navigates to the chat the message was posted in.
  3) In the tab buttons on the "My Chats" page.  These notifications have the same meaning as #2

Expected workflow

It is expected that an operator will be on the dashboards page when they have no chats.  When a chat appears, they should accept it, entering the chat.  When the chat is over, they should click "kick user", and then "leave".

If an operator is in a chat, and a new chat notification appears, they should return to the dashboard, accept the new chat, and then maintain both of their current chats.  The new message notifications on the tabs on the "My Chats" page will inform them when messages are posted in a different tab than they are currently viewing.

If an operator requires assistence in a chat, they should use the "invite" or "transfer" buttons to bring a different operator to the chat.

The "Join chat" button on the dashboard is availible for chats of most statuses.  This is to allow operators who have not been explicitly invited to enter the chat, for instance if an operator verbally requests help or must leave their computer during a chat.

The "Watch chat" button on the dashboard is availible for all chats.  This is to allow a supervisor to monitor an ongoing chat.
