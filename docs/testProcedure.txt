This is a general testing procedure which can be used to verify that a new version (on staging) does not break the main chat functionality.

  1. Log in with an operator that has 'foo.com' (or an owner): https://chatpro.com:4000/chat.html
  2. Create a new chat in another browser:  127.0.0.1:4000/chat.html#/newChat?websiteUrl=foo.com
  3. Dashboard should immediately update and chime should play.
  4. Click accept.
  5. Chat should be entered by Operator, Visitor should see notice.
  6. Send chat message from both Visitor and Operator.
  7. Messages should show on both sides.
  8. Kick user, leave chat.
