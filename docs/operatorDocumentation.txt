Operator documentation

Passwords

Operators log in using their email address and a password.  After logging in, clicking "My profile" in the left sidebar will show a page with a password change form.  All operators have the default password "password" when they are created, and should change to a more secure password immediately after their first login.

The Dashboard

This is the main page after logging in.  Here you'll find chats in progress and information about their status and who is chatting.

  Types of Chats

    Waiting: This is a new chat waiting for an operator.  The first operator to click "Accept" for such a chat will be placed into the chat, and the chat will be marked as "Active".

    Active: An active chat has a visitor and one or more operators in it.

    Invite: Another operator has invited you to join the chat.  Clicking "Accept" will cause you to enter the chat, and will change the chat status to "Active".

    Transfer: Another operator wants to transfer this chat to you.  Clicking "Assume" will accept the chat and eject the requestor.

    Vacant: A chat with the status of "Vacant" has no visitors in it.

  Additional Chat actions

    Join: Join a chat that is already in progress.  Any number of operators may join a chat

    Watch: Enter a chat invisible to other chat members.  You will recieve any messages posted in the room but will not be able to post.

The "My Chats" page

  This page has a tab for each chat the operator is currently in.  You can safely navigate away from this page; your chats will still be open when you return.  Each tab contains three sections:

  1) The main chat window.
  2) The message entry bar.
  3) The chat sidebar.  This shows information on the customer. Some information is shown in tree views: clicking on a field expands it and shows its subfields.  The chat sidebar also shows control buttons for the chat.

  The Chat Control Buttons

    Invite: Invites another operator to the chat.  Clicking it will open a user selection box displaying all other operators who are currently online.  Select one to invite them.

    Transfer: Transfers chat to another operator.  Transfers are like invites, only when an operator accepts a transfer, the operator who requested the transfer is removed from the room.

    Leave: Leave the room.  The visitor and other operators will recieve a message that you left.

    Kick: Kicks the user from the room.  The user will recieve the message "The operator has ended the chat" and will be unable to see any messages posted in the room after this point.

Notifications

  A number inside of a colored circle is a notification badge. They can appear several places:

  1) In the left sidebar, next to the link to the dashboard.  These show how many visitors are waiting for an operator.
  2) In the left sidebar, next to the "My Chats" link.  These show how many new messages you have.
  3) In the tab buttons on the "My Chats" page.  These show how many new messages are in that chat.

Expected workflow

The dashboard is the best place to wait for new chats.  The first operator who accepts a chat will be put in the chatroom.  When the chat is over, you should click "kick user", and then "leave".

If you are in a chat, and a new chat notification appears, you can return to the dashboard and accept the new chat.  The new message notifications on the tabs on the "My Chats" page will show you when the visitor in that chat has sent you a message.

If you require assistance in a chat, use the "invite" or "transfer" buttons to bring a different operator to the chat.

The "Join chat" button on the dashboard is to allow operators who have not been explicitly invited to enter the chat.  This is useful, for example, if an operator verbally requests help or must leave their computer during a chat.

The "Watch chat" button on the dashboard is availible for all chats.  This lets a supervisor monitor an ongoing chat.
